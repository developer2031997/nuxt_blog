### Safety Considerations

- **Quality Control**: Variability in product quality and potency can affect efficacy and safety.
- **Potential Side Effects**: Some herbal remedies may cause adverse reactions, interactions with medications, or allergic responses.
- **Regulatory Oversight**: Regulations governing herbal products vary by country, leading to potential inconsistencies in safety standards.

## Interactions with Conventional Medications
