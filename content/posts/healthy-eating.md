A balanced diet provides the necessary nutrients that the body needs to function effectively, including vitamins, minerals, protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Consuming a variety of foods in the right proportions helps to keep energy levels stable, supports bodily functions, and promotes a healthy weight.
